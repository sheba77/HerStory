The idea behind this project is to suggest a way to test if a book 
is "feminist" or not. The script will compare a chosen book with 
a predefined list of books that have been mark previously as "feminist" or
not and return the percentage of similarity between the gender based nouns in 
the chosen book and the marked books. 

so how do we do this?
we use the free books from www.gutenberg.org 
ahead of time we dived most books into feminist and not based on public decision.
Then we create a dict for each book that holds all the nouns 
that come ofter she/he for both the feminist books and the 
not feminist books.
we then use k-nearest neighbor algorithm to place any new book 
(also based on the nouns we find inside it)
